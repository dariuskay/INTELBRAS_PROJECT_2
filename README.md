# INTELBRAS_PROJECT_2
A chat project that includes a server and client.

To use, run "javac IntelbrasChatClient.java IntelbrasChatClientGUI.java IntelbrasChatServer.java IntelbrasChatServerGUI.java ChatMessage.java"
Then, run "java ServerGUI" and "java ClientGUI".

This is, unfortunately, buggy. I can't figure out why the same GUI command for a logout can't work for an incorrect password. After I figure it out, this is actually a pretty good, simple chat room application.

I received a lot of help from the Internet on this one, since I haven't worked with many of these types before. However, I believe this adequately represents my familiarity with the Java language.

The total chat is recorded by the ServerGUI and is displayed.
